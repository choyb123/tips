LIVEUPDATE related



- Run LiveUpdate manually:
- Open Symantec Endpoint Protection.
- Click LiveUpdate to force a definitions update.
- Wait for the update to complete and check if the error disappears.
- Restart your machine after updating—sometimes the status doesn’t refresh until reboot.
 If That Doesn’t Work…
Here are deeper troubleshooting steps:

1. Check for Expired License
- Devices with expired licenses won’t receive updates.
- Go to the Help > License Status section in the client to verify.

2. Corrupted Definitions
- Sometimes the virus definitions get corrupted.
- You can manually purge them using Symantec’s cleanup tool. Instructions are available on Broadcom’s support page.
3. LiveUpdate Failures
- If LiveUpdate connects but doesn’t install updates:
- Check your internet connection or proxy settings.
- Make sure the LiveUpdate client version is compatible with your SEP version.
- You can reinstall LiveUpdate using the installer that came with your SEP version.
4. Outdated Software Version
- If you're running SEP version 14.2 or older, it’s end-of-life and won’t receive updates.
- Upgrade to version 14.3.x or newer to stay protected.


 Steps to Reinstall LiveUpdate
1. Uninstall Existing LiveUpdate
- Go to Control Panel > Programs and Features.

3. Locate the Installer

- Follow the on-screen instructions to complete setup.

5. Register SEP with LiveUpdate

lucatalog.exe -cleanup
lucatalog.exe -forcedupdate
