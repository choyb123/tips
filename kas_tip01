Yes — klcfginst.msi is the installer for Kaspersky management plug‑ins. Running it adds the administration plug‑in for a specific Kaspersky product into the Kaspersky Security Center (KSC) console, 
so that KSC can recognize and manage that product.

How It Works
The Network Agent alone only connects endpoints to KSC.

To manage Endpoint Security for Linux, you need its management plug‑in installed in KSC.

The plug‑in installer is usually named klcfginst.msi and comes bundled with the product distribution kit.

Once installed, the plug‑in adds the product’s settings and tasks into the KSC console, enabling remote deployment and policy management

--Next Steps for Your Case
Download the Endpoint Security for Linux distribution kit from Kaspersky’s site.

Locate the klcfginst.msi file inside that kit.

Run it on the server where the KSC Administration Console is installed.

After installation, KSC will display Endpoint Security for Linux as a manageable application.

Add the Linux installer package into KSC and deploy it to endpoints via remote installation tasks.

Once you’ve installed the management plug‑in (klcfginst.msi) for Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Linux (KESL), you can add the .deb installer package into Kaspersky Security Center (KSC) 
so it can be deployed to endpoints.

Steps in the KSC Console
Open KSC Administration Console.

Navigate to:
Administration Server → Advanced → Remote Installation → Installation Packages.

Create a new installation package:

Right‑click Installation Packages → New → Installation Package from Executable File.

Browse to the kesl-xxx.deb file you downloaded.

KSC will wrap this into a deployable package.
Once the package is created, you’ll see Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Linux listed under installation packages.

Deploy to endpoints:

Go to Tasks → Remote Installation → New Task.

Select the package you just added.

Target the Linux endpoints that already have the Network Agent installed.

Run the task.

Verify installation:

After deployment, check the endpoint status in KSC. It should show both Network Agent and Endpoint Security for Linux installed.
