To check if UTL_TCP has been revoked from PUBLIC

SELECT PRIVILEGE, TABLE_NAME
FROM DBA_TAB_PRIVS
WHERE GRANTEE = 'PUBLIC'
  AND TABLE_NAME = 'UTL_TCP';



If you're unsure whether revoking this privilege will break anything, you can also check dependencies:

SELECT owner, name AS object_name, referenced_name AS reference
FROM dba_dependencies
WHERE referenced_name = 'UTL_TCP'
  AND referenced_owner IN ('SYS', 'PUBLIC')
  AND owner NOT IN ('SYS', 'PUBLIC');
======================================
These commands will show:
- Which global services are defined
- Whether they are started and registered
- Which databases are part of the GDS pool
- Whether services are enabled and globally started


GDSCTL> connect gsm -user gsmadmin_internal
GDSCTL> status service
GDSCTL> status database
GDSCTL> config service
GDSCTL> config database

Example output:
Database: "testdb"
Registered: Y
State: Ok
ONS: Y
Role: PRIMARY
Region: region1
Service: "test_service"
Globally started: Y
Started: Y

If you see no services, or all are disabled/not registered, it's safe to assume GDS is not actively used.
