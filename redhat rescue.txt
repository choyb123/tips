Booting Red Hat Linux into rescue mode is a powerful way to troubleshoot issues when your system won’t boot normally. Here are two common methods, depending on your version and setup:

Method 1: Using Installation Media (Anaconda Rescue Mode)
Insert the RHEL installation DVD/ISO or bootable USB.

Boot from it and at the boot prompt, type:

linux rescue
Follow the prompts to select language, keyboard, and network.

The system will attempt to mount your existing Linux installation under /mnt/sysimage.

To access it:

chroot /mnt/sysimage
Now you can reset passwords, fix configs, or repair filesystems.

Method 2: Break into Emergency Shell (rd.break)
Reboot your system and press e at the GRUB menu to edit the boot entry.

Find the line starting with linux and append:

rd.break
Press Ctrl + X or F10 to boot.

At the prompt:

mount -o remount,rw /sysroot
chroot /sysroot

Perform your fixes (e.g., reset root password with passwd root).

When done:

touch /.autorelabel
reboot -f
