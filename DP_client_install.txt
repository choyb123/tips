You can install Data Protector on a Linux client either remotely using the Installation Server or locally using the Unix installation package. Here’s a general guide:

Remote Installation
---------------------
Ensure the Linux client is reachable from the Installation Server.

Use the Installation Server for Linux to deploy the client remotely.

Run the installation command from the Installation Server.

Local Installation
--------------------
Mount the installation media:

bash
mount /dev/cdrom /media/cdrom
cd /media/cdrom/LOCAL_INSTALL
Install the required packages:

bash
aptitude install rpm
mkdir -p /var/lib/rpm
rpm --initdb
aptitude install netkit-inetd
Run the installation script:

bash
./omnisetup.sh -install da,ma
Verify the installation:

bash
tail /etc/services
grep omni /etc/inetd.conf

bash
./omnisetup.sh -install da,ma
is used to install Data Protector components on a Linux client. Here’s what each part of the command does:

./omnisetup.sh: Runs the Data Protector setup script from the current directory.

-install: Specifies that you want to install components.

da,ma: Indicates which components to install:

da (Disk Agent) – Enables backup and restore operations by managing file system interactions.

ma (Media Agent) – Handles communication between the client and backup devices, such as tape drives or disk storage.

After running this command, Data Protector sets up these components and registers the client with the Cell Manager (the central management server for Data Protector).

1. Check Running Processes
Ensure that Data Protector services are up and running:

bash
ps -ef | grep omni
If the processes related to omni are running, that’s a good sign.

2. Verify the Configuration Files
Check if the relevant files exist and contain expected configurations:

bash
ls -l /etc/opt/omni
cat /etc/inetd.conf | grep omni
If you see entries for Disk Agent (da) and Media Agent (ma), it means they were installed

3. Check the Client Registration
Run the following command to see if the client is registered with the Cell Manager:

bash
omnicc -query
The output should list the installed components.

4. Test Connectivity
Try communicating with the Cell Manager to ensure the client is functioning correctly:

bash
omnicheck -host <client_hostname>

5. Check Installed Packages
Verify that the correct packages were installed:

bash
rpm -qa | grep omni

1. Add the Client to the Data Protector Cell
Run the following command on the Cell Manager to add the new client:

bash
omnicc -add_host <client_hostname>
Replace <client_hostname> with the actual name or IP of the Linux client.

2. Verify Client Connectivity
Check if the Cell Manager can communicate with the client:

bash
omnicheck -host <client_hostname>
If there are connection issues, ensure firewall rules allow Data Protector traffic.

3. Assign Backup Configuration
Open the Data Protector GUI on the Cell Manager.

Navigate to Clients and verify that your Linux client appears.

Assign backup policies to the client so it can be included in scheduled backups.

4. Check Licensing
Ensure the required license for the Disk Agent (da) and Media Agent (ma) is active:

bash
omnicc -license

5. Run a Test Backup
Once everything is set up:

Create a test backup job that includes the Linux client.

Run the backup manually and check the logs:

bash
omnidb -session -latest
