1. Resize the qcow2 Disk Image
First, you’ll need to expand the qcow2 file using qemu-img. Run:

bash
qemu-img resize your-disk.qcow2 +10G
This increases the virtual disk size by 10GB (adjust the value as needed).

2. Resize the Partition
Once the disk is resized, you’ll need to extend the partition inside the qcow2 file. Boot the virtual machine and run:

bash
lsblk
Identify the partition to resize, then use parted:

bash
sudo parted /dev/vda
Inside parted, enter:

bash
resizepart NUMBER END
Replace NUMBER with the partition number (e.g., 1 for /dev/vda1) and END with the new size (e.g., 100% to use all available space).

3. Resize the Filesystem
After expanding the partition, grow the filesystem:

For ext4, run:

bash
sudo resize2fs /dev/vda1
For XFS, run:

bash
sudo xfs_growfs /dev/vda1
Your partition should now be expanded successfully!
