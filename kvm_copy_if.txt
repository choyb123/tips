Step 1: Archive Existing Bridge Configurations
On Oracle Linux (and most RHEL-based systems), bridge interfaces are defined in:

/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-* (for legacy network-scripts)

or 

/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/ (for NetworkManager-managed connections)

To back them up:

bash
mkdir -p ~/kvm-bridge-backup
cp /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-br* ~/kvm-bridge-backup/
cp /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth* ~/kvm-bridge-backup/
Or, if you're using NetworkManager:

bash
nmcli connection export br0 > ~/kvm-bridge-backup/br0.nmconnection

Repeat for each bridge.

Step 2: Transfer to New Host
Copy the backup folder to the new KVM host:

bash
scp -r ~/kvm-bridge-backup user@newhost:/tmp/

Step 3: Restore Bridge Configurations
On the new host:

For network-scripts:

bash
sudo cp /tmp/kvm-bridge-backup/ifcfg-* /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/
sudo systemctl restart network

For NetworkManager:

bash
nmcli connection import type bridge file /tmp/kvm-bridge-backup/br0.nmconnection
nmcli connection up br0

Bonus:
nmcli connection show --active | grep bridge)
