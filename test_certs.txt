Use OpenSSL to test and inspect certificates associated with Symantec Endpoint Protection or other software. Here’s a general approach:

Step 1: Export the Certificate
First, you need access to the certificate file (e.g., .pem, .crt) used by Symantec Endpoint Protection. You can often export these from the application or locate them in its installation folder.

Step 2: Use OpenSSL Commands
Once you have the certificate, OpenSSL can help you inspect and verify it:

1. View Certificate Details
openssl x509 -in <certificate_file> -text -noout

This displays all the information about the certificate, such as the issuer, validity period, and subject details.

2. Check Certificate Expiration
openssl x509 -enddate -noout -in <certificate_file>
This shows when the certificate expires.

3. Test Connectivity with Certificate
If Symantec Endpoint Protection uses TLS/SSL, you can test the connection:

openssl s_client -connect <server>:<port> -showcerts
Replace <server> and <port> with the endpoint’s address and port number. This command initiates a connection and shows the certificates used during the handshake.

4. Validate Certificate Chain
You can check if the certificate chain is complete and trusted:

openssl verify -CAfile <ca_file> <certificate_file>
Replace <ca_file> with the trusted certificate authority (CA) file and <certificate_file> with the certificate you want to verify.

The port depends on the service you're testing. For Symantec Endpoint Protection, common ports used are:

443: For secure HTTPS communication.

80: For unsecured HTTP communication.

8443: Often used for management console connections.

2967: Default for client-server communication in Symantec Endpoint Protection.
