Common Kaspersky Policy Settings That Block GPO
--Network traffic filtering / Firewall rules

If Kaspersky’s firewall policy blocks SMB, LDAP, or Kerberos traffic, endpoints cannot contact the domain controller to download GPOs.

Ports like TCP/UDP 135, 389, 445, 88 must remain open for Group Policy processing.

--Application Startup Control / HIPS

Policies that restrict svchost.exe, lsass.exe, or winlogon.exe can prevent the system from authenticating with the domain controller.

--Device Control / Network Control

If policies restrict access to network shares, the endpoint may fail to read the SYSVOL folder where GPOs are stored.

--Encryption or traffic inspection

SSL/TLS inspection policies can interfere with secure channel communication between the endpoint and domain controller.

--Policy inheritance conflicts in KSC

If the endpoint is placed in a Kaspersky group with stricter rules than intended, those rules override domain GPO application.


gpupdate /force, If it fails, check Kaspersky logs for blocked connections.

In KSC, review the applied security policy for that endpoint. Look at Network Settings → Firewall and Application Control.

Temporarily disable Kaspersky protection and retry gpupdate. If GPOs apply successfully, the block is within Kaspersky’s policy.
