====================================
Securing anonymous access in vsftpd is crucial to prevent unauthorized file access or misuse. Here are some steps you can take:

Restrict Write Permissions

  Set write_enable=NO to prevent anonymous users from uploading files.

Use anon_upload_enable=NO and anon_mkdir_write_enable=NO to ensure anonymous users cannot create directories or upload files.

Limit File Access

  Set anon_world_readable_only=YES to allow anonymous users to only read publicly accessible files.

Place files in a restricted directory (e.g., /var/ftp/pub) rather than allowing access to the entire system.

Chroot Anonymous Users

  Enable chroot_local_user=YES and chroot_list_enable=NO to prevent users from navigating outside their home directory.

Set Connection Limits

  Use max_clients=N and max_per_ip=M to control the number of simultaneous connections.

Configure idle_session_timeout=T to disconnect inactive users.

Log and Monitor Activity

  Enable logging with vsftpd_log_file=/var/log/vsftpd.log to track access and potential security threats.

Regularly review logs to detect suspicious activity.
