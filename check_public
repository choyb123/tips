To check if UTL_TCP has been revoked from PUBLIC

SELECT PRIVILEGE, TABLE_NAME
FROM DBA_TAB_PRIVS
WHERE GRANTEE = 'PUBLIC'
  AND TABLE_NAME = 'UTL_TCP';



If you're unsure whether revoking this privilege will break anything, you can also check dependencies:

SELECT owner, name AS object_name, referenced_name AS reference
FROM dba_dependencies
WHERE referenced_name = 'UTL_TCP'
  AND referenced_owner IN ('SYS', 'PUBLIC')
  AND owner NOT IN ('SYS', 'PUBLIC');
