Check Group Policy Settings
-Open gpedit.msc and look at these paths:

Computer Configuration → Administrative Templates → Windows Components → .NET Framework

-Ensure policies like Restrict .NET Framework usage or Do not allow .NET Framework installation are Disabled.

Computer Configuration → Administrative Templates → Windows Components → Windows Installer

Set Prohibit User Installs to Disabled. *

Set Only allow Windows Installer for managed applications to Disabled.

Computer Configuration → Windows Settings → Security Settings → Application Control Policies (AppLocker or Software Restriction Policies)  *

-Check if there are rules blocking setup.exe or preventing access to C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319.


Restore Registry Keys
Veritas System Recovery often checks these registry keys to detect .NET:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\NET Framework Setup\NDP\v4\Full

Look for Release and Version values.

On Windows 11, you should see something like Version = 4.8.x and a Release DWORD with a high value (greater than 528040).

If Group Policy or security software has hidden these keys, the installer reports “missing .NET 4.0.”

To fix: ensure the NDP\v4\Full key exists and isn’t blocked.

If missing, re‑enable the feature via Windows Features or run:

Old======DISM /Online /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:NetFx4 /All

DISM /Online /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:NetFx4-AdvSrvs /All

===========================
reg query "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\NET Framework Setup\NDP\v4\Full" /v Version
