To check if the Unified Management Console (UMC) is registered with the Symantec Data Center Security (SDCS) Management Server, follow these steps:

1. Verify Registration Status:

Open the UMC in your browser by navigating to:

https://<UMC_IP_or_Hostname>:8443/webportal
Log in with your credentials.

Check if the assets, policies, and other data from the Management Server are visible. If they are missing, the UMC might not be registered.

2. Use the Registration Tool:

On the Management Server, locate the registerProduct.bat script. It is typically found in:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Symantec\Data Center Security Server\Server\tools
Run the script as an administrator to re-register the UMC with the Management Server.

3. Check Logs:

Review the UMC and Management Server logs for any errors related to registration. Logs are usually located in the installation directory under logs.
