lvextend -L NEW_Size /dev/vg-group-name/lv-name

then you have to xfs_growfs to increase the size of an xfs filesystem:

xfs_growfs -d /dev/vg-group-name/lv-name


Just imagine you want to extend 5G:

lvextend -L +5G /dev/mapper/vggroup_name-lv_name -r
with the -r you can spare the command xfs_grow (-r will do its job).

Do not forget the + symbol in the 5G ---> -L +5G.
