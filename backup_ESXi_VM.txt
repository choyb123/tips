To manually back up your ESXi virtual machines (VMs), follow these steps:

1. Power Off the VM
Shut down the VM to ensure data consistency during the backup process.

2. Access the Datastore
Log in to the ESXi host using the VMware vSphere Client or Web Client.

Navigate to Storage and select the datastore where the VM resides.

3. Locate the VM Files
Browse the datastore and find the folder corresponding to the VM you want to back up. This folder typically contains files like:

.vmdk (virtual disk files)

.vmx (VM configuration file)

.log (log files)

.nvram (BIOS settings)

4. Copy the VM Files
Use the Download option in the vSphere Client to copy the entire VM folder to a secure backup location (e.g., an external drive or network storage).

Alternatively, use an SCP tool (e.g., WinSCP) to connect to the ESXi host and copy the files manually.

5. Verify the Backup
Ensure all necessary files have been copied. The .vmdk and .vmx files are critical for restoring the VM.

6. Restore the VM (if needed)
To restore, upload the backed-up files to the datastore and register the VM by right-clicking the .vmx file and selecting Add to Inventory.

This method is straightforward but requires downtime for the VM. If you'd like to automate or optimize this process, tools like ghettoVCB or scripts can help streamline manual backups
