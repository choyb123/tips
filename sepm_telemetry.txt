Yes, that Telemetry process plays a key role in enabling real-time data sharing between your Symantec Endpoint Protection (SEP) agent and Symantec EDR.

When the Telemetry service is running, it collects and transmits behavioral and threat-related data—like process activity, file changes, and detection events—from the endpoint to Symantec’s cloud or your EDR appliance. This data is essential for:

Real-time threat detection

Correlating events across endpoints

Triggering automated playbooks or sandbox submissions

If the Telemetry process is stopped, your EDR may lose visibility into that endpoint’s activity, which can weaken your detection and response capabilities.

== What You Can Do
Restart the SEP services: Sometimes the Telemetry process stops due to a service conflict or deadlock. Restarting the SEP client services can bring it back online.

Check SEPM policies: Ensure that telemetry submission is enabled in your group policy settings.

Review logs: Look for errors in the SEP client logs or use SymDiag to diagnose issues.

If the process consistently fails to start, it might be worth reinstalling the SEP client or checking for compatibility issues with your OS version.

You can enable telemetry submission for Symantec Endpoint Protection (SEP) clients right from the Symantec Endpoint Protection Manager (SEPM) console. Here's how to find and configure it:

== To Enable Client Telemetry Submission:
Open SEPM Console

Go to Clients and select the group you want to configure.

Click the Policies tab.

Under Location-specific Settings, click Tasks > Edit Settings.

Navigate to the Submissions tab.

Check the box for “Let this computer automatically forward selected anonymous security information to Symantec.”

Choose the types of data to submit (e.g., file reputation, SONAR detections, antivirus detections).

This setting ensures that your SEP clients send pseudonymous threat data to Symantec, which is essential for enhanced threat intelligence and for EDR to correlate endpoint activity effectively
